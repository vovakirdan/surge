# Epic 4 Evidence

This file is the task evidence ledger for Epic 4, persistent fd registry and
net lifecycle ownership. Keep entries short, exact, and command-backed.

## Starting Evidence

- Epic 3 is complete for owner-local waiters and dependency-aware runtime
  refactoring under `N=1`.
- Persistent fd registry, net lifecycle ownership, accept distribution, `N>1`,
  crossing syntax, and backend I/O changes were not implemented in Epic 3.
- Current net polling still builds temporary fd rows from net waiter state in
  `runtime/native/rt_net.c`.
- Current known line-count debt from Epic 3 closeout:
  - `runtime/native/rt_async_state.c`: 1731 lines;
  - `runtime/native/rt_net.c`: 1024 lines;
  - `runtime/native/rt_async_trace.c`: 497 lines;
  - `runtime/native/rt_async_internal.h`: 499 lines.
- The broad focused VM command
  `go test ./internal/vm -run 'MT|Async|Net|LLVM'` remains accepted
  backend-test debt and is not an Epic 4 green gate.
- Sentrux rule files were added during pre-Epic 4 quality hardening for root,
  `runtime/`, and `runtime/native`.

## Draft Creation Evidence

- `git diff --check`: passed with empty output after creating the Epic 4
  document set.
- Sentrux repository scan for `/home/zov/projects/surge/surge` returned
  `quality_signal=6198`, `files=4775`, `import_edges=1890`, and
  `lines=377913`.
- Sentrux rules were added after draft creation. Root `sentrux check .` passes
  with quality `6198`.
- Sentrux runtime scan for `/home/zov/projects/surge/surge/runtime` returned
  `quality_signal=5195`, `files=35`, `import_edges=33`, and `lines=15275`.
- Runtime `sentrux check runtime` passes with quality `5195`.
- Sentrux runtime/native scan for
  `/home/zov/projects/surge/surge/runtime/native` returned
  `quality_signal=5159`, `files=34`, `import_edges=33`, and `lines=15260`.
- Runtime/native `sentrux check runtime/native` passes with quality `5159`.
- MCP `check_rules` also passes for root, `runtime/`, and `runtime/native`.
